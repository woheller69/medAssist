## ✨ Features

| Feature                   | Description                                                                                  |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **100% offline**          | All inference runs locally via GGUF on-device model execution                                |
| **Privacy-first**         | Zero network calls, no internet permission — your text never leaves the device                      |
| **Auto-detect source**    | Choose "auto" to let the model guess the input language, or pick a specific one manually     |
| **Swap languages**        | One tap to reverse source ↔ target with full custom-language support                         |
| **Custom language codes** | Select "Other" on either side and type any IETF BCP-47 code                                  |
| **Voice input**           | Install Whisper+ from F-Droid for this feature or any other voice input that supports intent |
| **Voice output**          | Via system text-to-speech. It is recommended to use SherpaTTS from F-Droid                   |
| **System theme**          | Follows your device's light/dark setting automatically                                       |

## 🤖 Model Setup

The app requires a TranslateGemma GGUF model file at runtime. On first launch, you are redirected to the **Setup Activity** where you can:

### Download model

Tap **Download**, which opens Hugging Face in your browser:

[translategemma-4b-it.Q4_K_M.gguf](https://huggingface.co/mradermacher/translategemma-4b-it-GGUF/blob/main/translategemma-4b-it.Q4_K_M.gguf)

> ⚠️ The model file is ~2.5 GB. Ensure a stable Wi-Fi connection.


### Install

Tap **Install Model**, select the `.gguf` file from your device using the system document picker, and the app copies it into its private storage.

Once the model is in place, tap **Start** to launch the translator.

---

## 🚀 Using the App

1. **Enter or paste** text in the *Input* field.
2. Choose a **Source language** (or leave on *Auto Detect*).
3. Choose a **Target language**.
4. Tap the **Swap** button (↔) to reverse languages.
5. Input your text via keybord or tap **Microphone** button
6. Tap **Translate** and wait for results — output streams token by token in real time.
7. Tap **Speak** for voice output

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

| Issue | Possible Fix |
|---|---|
| Model fails to load | Ensure the `.gguf` file is fully copied and not corrupted. Re-download if needed. |
| Very slow translations | Q4 quantization requires a mid-to-high-end device. Consider a less-quantized model (Q5/K_M) on powerful hardware, or accept slower speeds. |
| "Auto Detect" cannot be swapped | Intentional — swapping would make auto-detection ambiguous. Change source to a specific language first. |
